Specific assignments include: putting together the weekly reports for investors, creating reports that are sent out to the Nittany Lion Fund (NLF), and providing assistance with pitches. In general, an Associate Manager is supposed to be well informed about the sector's current holdings and with that, an Associate should be able to provide support for the Lead Manager during a stock pitch or class discussion. Although Associate Fund Managers are the workhorses of the fund, often performing some of the more tedious tasks, the position offers the opportunity to learn from the Lead Managers as well as make an impression by delivering quality work. While Lead Managers are responsible for and have the final say in stock pitches and sector strategies, it is highly encouraged that the Associates provide their Lead Managers with pitch ideas as well as inform them of their opinions about current market trends. Ultimately, the Associate Manager position is more detail and task oriented than the Lead Fund Manager position. However, there is always room to provide high quality insight into the market by asking thought provoking questions during pitches and staying current on market news. Students use financial software, such as Bloomberg Professional, Reuters Station, TradeStation, and FactSet, and must have working knowledge of various forms of financial modeling. The Penn State Investment Association (PSIA), which co-exists with the Nittany Lion Fund, LLC (NLF) assists the NLF in ensuring students are appropriately trained in these skills. The PSIA is open to students of all majors and experience levels and is the starting point for students interested in participating in the NLF.", "instructor1": "Christoph Hinkelmann ", "time": "MoWeFr 10:10AM -

Students will complete a minimum of 200-250 clock hours under the supervision of a certified athletic trainer in a variety of clinical settings. These settings include but are not limited to: outpatient sports medicine clinics, interscholastic athletic settings, and intercollegiate athletic settings. The objectives of this course include demonstrating proficiency in: assisting lower level students in developing athletic training skills and mastering level-appropriate competencies; demonstrate proficiency in evaluation and documentation of common athletic injuries; assist in the development and documentation of a plan of care for common athletic injuries; demonstrate proficiency in the development and documentation of clinical progression through a plan of care; participate in the application of therapeutic modalities and therapeutic exercise under the supervision of a certified athletic trainer.In this practical experience, the student is required to demonstrate an understanding of the classroom experiences completed to date and as required by the program option up to the current semester. This practicum has a prerequisite requirement of KINES 395F and is a prerequisite for the subsequent athletic training practicum, KINES 395I. Assessment is based on student performance written examinations, practical examinations, written assignments, and performance assessments by supervising athletic trainer(s).
